a) relative clauses
b) "I wonder" clauses
c) adverbial clauses (ex. Sally sighed when the president ate sandwich)
d) object possession with multiple adjectives (ex. the chief of staffâ€™s perplexed fine sandwich)
e) particular order of adjectives: when describing some- thing with more than one adjective, you arrange the adjectives in a specific order (quality, size, age, shape, color).
